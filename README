django-jsonfield is a Django model field that stores arbitrary data as
serialized JSON.

It was originally written by deadwisdom[1] and later revised and submitted
as a patch to Django by Patrick Altman[2][3]. Here it is presented as a
module structured for easy inclusion in other projects as a git submodule.
